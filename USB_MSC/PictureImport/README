USB Mass Storage Read/LS
========================

This example code works on Linux/MacOS/iPhone OS Systems.

This code can use the following environment variables:
 - USB_DEVICE=<vid>:<pid>

On a Mac/iPhone system use `ioreg -p IOUSB' to find the
VID/PID for the specified USB device, or use `lsusb' to
find the device identifier on a Linux system.

Usage:
======

 usb_ls:
    usb_ls [dir]

    usb_ls will list the current directory for specified [dir]
    from the USB mass storage device.

 usb_cp
    usb_cp [file] 

    usb_cp will copy the [file] from the USB storage device to the
    main device.

Compiling
=========

Use make usb_cp to build usb_cp for a generic Linux system.

Use make usb_ls to build usb_ls for a generic Linux system.
